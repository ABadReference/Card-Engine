# Card Engine
Creating a simple foundation for card games

# Card games?
Yep, card games. I'm goint to see how many card games I can program using a standard 52 card deck.
Considering that I can make any kind of deck, any card game is possible once the logic is there.

## In progress:
Poker:

    TODO:
    - Finish revamping how flushes and striaghts are calculated
    - Fix pairs so it returns the 5 card hand with pairs
    - start work on the rest of the win conditions

## Future:
Actually make the long waited poker game
