# Card Engine
Creating a simple foundation for card games

# Card games?
Yep, card games. I'm going to see how many card games I can program using a standard 52 card deck.
Considering that I can make any kind of deck, any card game is possible once the logic is there.

## Done:

- Stright doesn't seem to have any more bugs with it
- Pairs and two pairs are functional
- flush is working, but can be opitimzed
- sorting by face and suit are working as intended, sort by suit can be optimized
- Deck building

## In progress:
Poker:
    
- add stright flush and royal flush
- optimize search
- chips/cash calculations
- add "weight" system for poker hand evaluation

## Future:

- implement pygame
- Make graphics and release a demo for "The Worst Card Game"
- black jack
