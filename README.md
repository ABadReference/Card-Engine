# Card Engine
Creating a simple foundation for card games

# Card games?
Yep, card games. I'm going to see how many card games I can program using a standard 52 card deck.
Considering that I can make any kind of deck, any card game is possible once the logic is there.

## In progress:
Poker:
    
- Add the remaining win conditions
- implement pygame
- chips/cash calculations
- iron out the remaining bugs
- optimize search

## Future:

- Make graphics and release a demo for "The Worst Card Game"
- black jack
